<p class=section>4 April 2001.</p> Documentation updates. Also now available in
<a href="octal_api.pdf">PDF format</a>. 

<p class=section>24 March 2001. Anonymous CVS access, API revisions, and
status report.</p> You may wonder why it's been a few weeks since the last tarball. The
answer is that Octal is now stored in GNU CVS, and is available for anonymous
checkout. The following commands will check out the latest development version:

<p>
<pre>
cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/octal login
 
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/octal co octal
</pre>

<p>March saw a lot of discussion and new ideas on the mailing list; this
illustrated the need for several minor enhancements to the Octal API. These
should be the last incompatible changes; it's better to do them sooner than
later. There are several superficial changes (ox_event instead of ox_update)
and one signature change (ox_channel instead of ox_track.) The API for
specifying parameters has also been simplified, so that you can use a string
like "cutoff:filter cutoff frequency:generic:slider:100:22000:8000" instead of
a big <tt>struct</tt>. This will be more robust to future changes
(in case parameters ever acquire more attributes.) Another improvement is the
use of floating-point numbers for all machine parameter data, which will
eliminate having to convert a 0...255 range into something else. 

There are more details about these changes in the Octal API manual. 



<p class=section>6 March 2001.</p> 0.92.3b is at the download site. This version includes the new widget-builder code and examples on how to use it. I've also updated the webpage's graphics to include screenshots.  
<p class=section>25 February 2001. Minor update<p>0.92.2beta is at the download site.

<!-- about the project -->
<p class=section>About the project</p>


OCTAL is a GNU project (started in 1999) to create a free music system based on unit generator synthesis, sampling, and audio-plugin technology. It consists of:

<ol>
<li> A music-systems <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/octal/ox_api_main/index.html">plugin API</a>, 
used to define sound processing objects called "machines" that users may download from the web to use 
as instruments or effects in their compositions.  
<li> A core component to load these machines, communicate with them, route and mix audio signals between 
them, and produce output on an audio device. 
<li> A graphical user interface (using the Gimp Toolkit) to interactively create, compose, and perform 
music using the core as a backend.
<li> An open file format for saving these compositions and the associated resources (sound samples, 
plugin machines) that comprise them.
</ol>

<p>As of March 2001, part one is essentially stable; parts two and three are currently 
in usable "developer's releases" and are progressing quickly. The eventual goal of this 
project is to create a completely free-software music system (plugin modules and all) 
and an archival format so that the work put into compositions can last with time.
